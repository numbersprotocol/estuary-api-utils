# Estuary API Utils

Estuary project [terminated on 2023-08-10](https://x.com/Estuary_Tech/status/1689468956980228096?s=20), so this repository is also archived.

Scripts for testing the [Estuary APIs](https://docs.estuary.tech/).

## Usage

1. Copy `env.sh.example` to `env.sh`.
2. Update your API key into `env.sh`.
3. Run the scripts, maybe with input parameters.
